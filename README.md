# professionalPortfolio

This README file contains the title of my project, Olu Dada's Professional Porfolio, and has live links to 3 deployed apps built and listed.  
Several technologies were employed during the deploymeny of these 3 Apps, and they include, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, AJAX, API, local storage, and others.  
The Recipe project app uses all the above technologies in retrieving mouth watering recipes for users while avoiding food allergies and other sensitivities.  
The second app is a 5-Day Weather Dashboard which retrieves current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and ultraviolet conditions in cities all around the United States.  It uses local storage to store weather parameters of listed cities.  
The last BootStrap App was able to display furnitures of a local store and used BootStrap CSS which was reactive. Prospective customers could order local furnitures on display and app was reactive and could be used on different screen sizes. 
Three screen shots were provided with this submission and the licenses were provided by MIT.
